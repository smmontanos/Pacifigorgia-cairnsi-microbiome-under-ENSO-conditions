The microbial community analysis for Pacifigorgia cairnsi octocoral from Colombian Pacific ocean under ENSO phenomenon.
First, the analysis of the amplicon sequences (16s RNA, V4 region) were performed in QIIME2 (See file 1).
Then, taxonomy and ASV table were obtained from QIIME2. Metadata file is included here (See DATA folder).
Finally, R were used to perform the analyses of the bacterial community (See file 2)
